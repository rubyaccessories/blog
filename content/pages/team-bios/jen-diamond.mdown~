O------------------ Feats of Daring ------------------------O

This is an open source project that Jen Diamond created and maintains. It is a learning app to help people learn Ruby by learning about aspects of the Ruby Standard Library. It is a work in progress. 

Jen spent the summer of 2014 working with Pivotal Labs and a team of 4 to start building this site. Jen continues to build it with a new team and on her own. The goal is to be able to launch it by the end of 2015. It will be an excellent resource for the Ruby community. There are many plans to continue to grow it over time.
